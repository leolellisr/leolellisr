### Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Electrical Engineering MSc and Control and Automation Engineer, graduated from the Institute of Science and Technology of Sorocaba (ICTS UNESP).

I am currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC/UNICAMP). I'm member of the Cognitive Architectures area at H.IAAC (Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub) which aims the development and dissemination of technologies capable of integrating intelligence resources in mobile devices, making them able to take decisions. 

My research area involves Automation, Cognitive Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I am also an organization member at RoboCup Brasil, helping to organize national educational robotics events:
* [Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR)](https://www.obr.org.br)

* [National Robotics Fair (MNR)](https://www.mnr.org.br)
