### Hi :)



I'm an Electrical Engineering MSc and Control and Automation Engineer, graduated from the [Institute of Science and Technology of Sorocaba (ICTS UNESP)](https://www.sorocaba.unesp.br). My master's dissertation was ["Sensorimotor learning in cognitive robots using the CST-CONAIM model"](http://hdl.handle.net/11449/214316). We also had a published paper: ["Learning over the Attentional Space with Mobile Robots"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL-EpiRob48136.2020.9278119).


I am currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC/UNICAMP)](https://www.fee.unicamp.br). I'm member of the [Cognitive Architectures area at H.IAAC (Hub of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures)](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/students/) which aims the development and dissemination of technologies capable of integrating intelligence resources in mobile devices, making them able to take decisions. 

My research areas involve Automation, Cognitive Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I am also an organization member at [RoboCup Brasil](https://www.robocup.org.br/wp/quem-somos/), helping to organize national educational robotics events:
* [Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR)](https://www.obr.org.br)

* [National Robotics Exhibition (MNR)](https://www.mnr.org.br)

* [Brazilian Robotics Competition (CBR) / Latin America Robotics Competition (LARC)](https://www.cbrobotica.org)
