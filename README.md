### 🖖 Alola!



I'm an Electrical Engineering MSc and Control and Automation Engineer, graduated from the [Institute of Science and Technology of Sorocaba (ICTS UNESP)](https://www.sorocaba.unesp.br). My master's dissertation was ["Sensorimotor learning in cognitive robots using the CST-CONAIM model"](http://hdl.handle.net/11449/214316). My master's dissertation won the first place in the Robotics Theses and Dissertations Competition, 2022 edition, with the work ["Aprendizado procedimental e sensório-motor em robôs cognitivos" ("Procedural and sensorimotor learning in cognitive robots")](https://doi.org/10.5753/wtdr_ctdr.2022.227371). We also had a published paper: ["Learning over the Attentional Space with Mobile Robots"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL-EpiRob48136.2020.9278119).


I am currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC/UNICAMP)](https://www.fee.unicamp.br). I'm member of the [Cognitive Architectures area at H.IAAC (Hub of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures)](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/students/) which aims the development and dissemination of technologies capable of integrating intelligence resources in mobile devices, making them able to take decisions. Recently, we had a published paper: ["Piagetian experiments to DevRobotics"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101170).

My research areas involve Automation, Cognitive Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I am also an organization member at [RoboCup Brasil](https://www.robocup.org.br/wp/quem-somos/), helping to organize national educational robotics events in Brazil:
* [Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR)](https://www.obr.org.br)

* [National Robotics Exhibition (MNR)](https://www.mnr.org.br)

* [Brazilian Robotics Competition (CBR) / Latin America Robotics Competition (LARC)](https://www.cbrobotica.org)
